                <p>
                    My name is Kavin Siaw and I come from Malaysia. I am currently majoring in Physics at Brigham Young University - Idaho. 
                    I am a junior and I am excited to learn more about web development.
                    Comming to school at BYU-Idaho is one of the greatest decision that I have made for my life besides baptism.
                    This is because I want to become an astrophysist in the furture and attending BYU-Idaho will help me step close to my career goal.
                    Becasue of my ambitious, I have been working hard to study in physics and math. This helps me to be ready for future challenges.
                    I am also been blessed to award for a scholarship so that I do not have to worried about paying for my tuition. 
                    Because of this, it helps me to be closer the man that I want to be so that I have the ability to help others in the future.

                    Ipoh is the main city in the Perak state in Malaysia. 
                    In Perak state, there are hills and mountains that give evergreen plants to beautify the area.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Ipoh grew out from the Malay village of Paloh along the banks of the Kinta River in the 1880s. 
                    Its geographic location in the rich tin-bearing valley of the Kinta River made it a natural centre of growth.

                <p class="text">
                    Ipoh was invaded by the Japanese on 15 December 1941. In March 1942, 
                    the Japanese Civil Administration or Perak Shu Seicho was set up at St. Michael's Institution. 
                    After the liberation of Malaya by British forces, Ipoh remained the capital of Perak as it does to this day.
